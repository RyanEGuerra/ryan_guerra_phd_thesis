\chapter{WARPLab 7.4 Modifications for WURC}
\label{sec_warplab_arch}

Here, we present a generated diagram mapping the entire WARPLab Version 7.4 \cite{warplab} software architecture hierarchy of function calls and highlighting the calls that needed to be modified to support the WURC \ac{PHY}.

Function calls with \textbf{blue} titles in Figure~\ref{fig_warplab_arch} were untouched, where as functions calls with \textbf{purple} labels had to be modified to extend their functionality.

For example: operations like {IFC\_CHANNEL}: would need to be augmented to extend the WARPLab supported channels to UHF channels.

We extended the WARPLab Node object with a new \texttt{wsd\_node} object that called into overridden MATLAB functions.
WARPLab scripts that wished to utilize WARPv3 board augmented with WURC would initialize them as \texttt{wsd\_nodes} and generally follow the same procedures as before.
Finally, we wrote WARPLab \acp{API} to directly execute arbitrary \ac{WURC} macros, including raw register read/write operations on the LMS6002D register map, providing full access to WARPLab experimental scripts.
